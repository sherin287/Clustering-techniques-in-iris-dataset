Clustering techniques  in iris dataset
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques in iris dataset.
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known and widely used datasets in machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of the Iris flower:
Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica
Each flower sample is described by four numerical features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
Since the dataset contains three naturally occurring clusters (species), it is an excellent candidate for unsupervised clustering techniques such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
